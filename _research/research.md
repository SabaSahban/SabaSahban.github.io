# Research Overview üßë‚Äçüíª

I‚Äôm currently conducting research in the **AUT Cloud Lab (LPDS)** under the supervision of **Dr. Momtazpour**. My research primarily focuses on federated learning, distributed systems, cloud/edge computing, and scalable networks. I am particularly interested in developing and optimizing systems that facilitate collaboration between devices while preserving data privacy and reducing latency.

## Research Interests üîç

- **Federated Learning**: Developing distributed learning models that can train on edge devices without sharing raw data.
- **Distributed Systems**: Exploring the design and implementation of scalable systems that can run across multiple devices.
- **Cloud/Edge Computing**: Optimizing resource usage in cloud environments and enabling real-time processing at the network edge.
- **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Researching how edge devices can collaborate effectively in distributed environments.
- **Operating Systems & Computer Networks**: Investigating systems that support efficient networking and communication in distributed settings.
- **Applied Machine Learning**: Applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems across various domains.


## Current Research Topics üöÄ

### 1. **Split Learning**
Working on implementing split learning within federated systems to reduce communication costs and enable edge devices to train models collaboratively while sharing minimal data.

### 2. **Mobility**
Exploring mobility in federated learning environments, focusing on how devices can dynamically connect to and migrate between edge nodes without compromising model performance or latency.

### 3. **Semi-Decentralized Architectures**
Studying different architectures for semi-decentralized systems to improve the scalability, resilience, and efficiency of federated learning networks deployed on edge devices.

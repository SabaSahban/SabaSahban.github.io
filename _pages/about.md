# About Me 👋

Hi, I’m **Saba Sahban**, a passionate 22-year-old computer engineering student from Tehran, Iran. I’m currently in my final semester at **Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)** 🎓, and I’m excited about the next step in my journey—pursuing a master’s degree abroad 🌍.

At present, I’m conducting research in the **AUT Cloud Lab (LPDS)** 🧑‍💻 under the supervision of **Dr. Momtazpour**. My thesis focuses on developing a federated learning framework with a team of six, exploring cutting-edge approaches to decentralized and distributed systems 🚀. My work spans several innovative projects, each centered around my passion for federated learning, cloud/edge computing, and scalable systems ☁️.

Outside of academics, I’m a huge music lover 🎶. I used to play bass and electric guitar in a band called **Stendhal Music Band**, and I’m a big fan of **Opeth** and **Tool**. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres and exploring new sounds. 🎸

#### Here's our band playing:

In my free time, I love playing **tennis** and **badminton** 🏸, and I also enjoy spending time in nature 🌿, where I can relax and recharge.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! 🤝

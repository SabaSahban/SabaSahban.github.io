Hello, I’m **Saba Sahban**, a 22-year-old computer engineering student from Tehran, Iran. I’m currently in my final semester at **Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic)**, and I'm planning to pursue a master’s degree abroad.

At present, I’m conducting research in the **AUT Cloud Lab (LPDS)** under the supervision of **Dr. Momtazpour**. My thesis title is: Implementing a semi-decentralized framework for running federated learning on edge networks.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! 🤝
